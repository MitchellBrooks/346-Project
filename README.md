# Software Engineering Project
This is a copy of a repoistory two of my classmates and I worked on for our software engineering class. The repository was originally on github.iu.edu (github enterprise) so unfortunately you cannot see all of the commits and changes we made along the way. 
The repository contains a website we created from scratch that acts as a polling site where users can register to create and vote on polls.
